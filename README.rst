Ariel Roff√©'s Quest (my personal website)
=========================================

Code for the game and website at `https://arielroffe.quest <https://arielroffe.quest/>`__.

To run it locally, simply clone this repo, cd into it, start a webserver and navigate to `localhost`.

The game was made with the `Phaser 3 <https://phaser.io/>`__ game engine.

The assets used all come from public domain sources, and/or were edited by myself.
Specifically:

- I used `these <https://www.deviantart.com/chaoticcherrycake/art/Pokemon-Tileset-From-Public-Tiles-358379026>`__ `two <https://www.deviantart.com/chaoticcherrycake/art/Public-Indoor-Tileset-From-Public-Tiles-483814875>`__ Pokemon style tilesets by ChaoticCherryCake (and other artists, see the full credits in those links). I also took a few sprites (especially NPCs) from `PokeFans <https://fanart.pokefans.net/tutorials/mapping/tilesets>`__, and a few more from `OpenGameArt <https://opengameart.org/>`__ (e.g `this <https://opengameart.org/content/superpowers-assets-bitmap-fonts>`__ and `this <https://opengameart.org/content/cc0-book-icons>`__). I compiled all tiles I used into the file at `assets/prod/tilesets_and_maps/tileset.png` using GIMP.
- The tilemaps were made by myself, using `Tiled <https://www.mapeditor.org/>`__.
- The 8 bit remixes of Bob-omb Battlefield, Outset Island and Koopa Troopa Beach are by Bulby, and were included with his permission. Check out his awesome YouTube channel `here <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz6zvgkf6eKpgqlUZQstOtQ>`__.
- The pixel font is `Pixel Operator <https://notabug.org/HarvettFox96/ttf-pixeloperator>`__ by HarvettFox96.
